<h1>KCL High Performance Computing Resources</h1>

For neuroimaging analysis that requires significant amounts of data processing there are two main options for parallelising workflows: Rosalind and the Neuroimaging analysis Network (the NaN). Rosalind has much greater compute power, while the NaN has a large selection of preinstalled neuroimaging software, a virtual desktop interface, and very helpful support. Below are guides to setting up analysis workflows on each.
